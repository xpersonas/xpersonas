> Full-stack developer focused on the space between UI, CMS, and architecture.

# Justin Neel (xpersonas)

Programmer for roughly ~96 years.

I’m a full-stack developer who started in the front end, went deep into the backend, and learned that great products live in the space between.

I care just as much about how something *feels* as how it’s built. Clean markup, thoughtful UI, and a CMS that doesn’t fight the user matter as much as architecture, performance, and long-term maintainability.

My core expertise is Drupal and Symfony. I’m comfortable in Laravel. On the front end, I’ve worked with React, but these days I lean heavily toward Vue/Nuxt — it fits how I think and how I like to build.

> I care deeply about editorial experience — users shouldn't hate their CMS.

I’ve worked across Drupal, WordPress, Strapi, Contentful, and other backend systems, often bridging teams and disciplines to make sure everything actually works together — from CMS and APIs to hosting, DNS, build tools, and deployment.

Details matter. Code matters. Design matters.  
Tailwind: no.

- 🧱 **Backend:** PHP (Drupal, Symfony, Laravel, WordPress, Strapi), APIs, integrations  
- ⚡ **Frontend:** modern JavaScript, component-driven UIs, performance-focused UX  
- 🚀 **Delivery:** pragmatic DevOps, hosting, DNS, CI/CD, reliability
